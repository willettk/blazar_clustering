	Abstract = {Images centered on 108 quasars with redshifts between 0.05 and 2.05 were obtained using the direct-SIT camera on the Palomar 1.52 m telescope. This paper presents the analyzed data without a priori assumptions about the nature of quasar redshifts and shows that the results are consistent with the hypothesis that quasars are associated with galaxies at the cosmological distances implied by the quasar redshifts. By assuming that quasars are at their cosmological redshift distances, some of the physical properties of the groups and clusters that are apparently associated with the quasars are derived. Marginally significant differences were found between the environments of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars.},

	Abstract = {Images in Gunn r (6500 + or - 450 A) and i (8200 + or - 600 A) of fields around 31 bright quasars have been obtained for the purpose of studying the global environments of quasars. Procedures for object identification, aperture photometry, and object classification are discussed. A catalog of the positional offsets from the quasar and the magnitudes and classifications of the detected objects is presented. In addition, selected control fields positioned 1 deg north of some quasars, for the purpose of background galaxy counting, were also observed. Despite the small area covered, the average background galaxy counts obtained agree well with previous results. For r over 21 mag, the distributions of counts in the 27 control fields are found to deviate significantly from Poisson statistics.},

	Abstract = {An analysis is performed of the evolution of quasar/AGN activity in rich clusters by combining samples of both radio-loud quasars (RLQs) and radio galaxies. Using data from the literature, the optical luminosity function (LF) of radio-loud quasars is modeled, and the model is used to study the LF evolution and its dependence on cluster environment. It is demonstrated that low-redshift radio galaxies and optically bright RLQs at higher redshift may form a single-parameter family. The level of activity in radio galaxies at the current epoch is consistent with the extrapolation of the evolution of RLQs. It is also shown that, if RLQs in all environments have the same bright-end LF slope, then AGNs in rich galaxy clusters evolve 5-6 times more rapidly than those in poor environments. By studying the properties of environments hosting a wide range of AGN activity, the dominant environmental parameters important for the occurrence of quasar activity can be determined.},

	Abstract = {Using photometric catalogs from wide-field CCD images, we derive the cluster-galaxy correlation amplitudes, B_gc, for 47 low-redshift Abell clusters. We apply a number of tests to establish the robustness of the B_gc parameter as a quantitative measure of richness of galaxy clusters. These include using different galaxy luminosity functions to normalize the excess galaxy counts, counting galaxies to different absolute magnitude limits, and counting galaxies to different cluster-centric radii. These tests show that with a properly normalized luminosity function, the B_gc parameter is relatively insensitive (at better than 1/2 of an Abell richness class) to magnitude limit, areal coverage, and photometric errors of up to about 0.25 mag. We compare the B_gc-values to both the Abell richness class (ARC) and Abell count numbers (N_A). It is found that there is a good correlation between B_gc and N_A for Abell clusters with z<~0.1, with a dispersion of about 1 ARC, whereas the Abell richness classifications for Abell clusters at z>~0.1 are much less well correlated with the true cluster richness. We also find evidence that the richness of ARC>=3 clusters has the tendency of being overestimated in the Abell catalog.},

	Abstract = {The spatial cluster-galaxy correlation amplitude, Bgc, is computed for a set of 76 z<0.3 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) from the 1 Jy sample. The Bgc parameter is used to quantify the richness of the environment within 0.5 Mpc of each ULIRG. We find that the environment of local ULIRGs is similar to that of the field with the possible exceptions of a few objects with environmental densities typical of clusters with Abell richness classes 0 and 1. No obvious trends are seen with redshift, optical spectral type, infrared luminosity, or infrared color (f25/f60). We compare these results with those of local AGNs and QSOs at various redshifts. The 1 Jy ULIRGs show a broader range of environments than local Seyferts, which are exclusively found in the field. The distribution of ULIRG Bgc-values overlaps considerably with that of local QSOs, consistent with the scenario where some QSOs go through a ultraluminous infrared phase. However, a rigorous statistical analysis of the data indicates that these two samples are not drawn from the same parent population. The Bgc distribution of QSOs shows a distinct tail at high Bgc-values, which is not apparent among the ULIRGs. This difference is consistent with the fact that some of the QSOs used for this comparison have bigger and more luminous hosts than the 1 Jy ULIRGs.},

	Abstract = {The results of an extensive imaging survey of BL Lac objects conducted at the Canada-France-Hawaii 3.6 m Telescope (CFHT) are presented. This paper details the results pertinent to the clustering environments of BL Lacs; a companion paper (Wurtz, Stocke, & Yee) presented results on the host galaxies of BL Lacs obtained from the same Gunn r-band images. The clustering environments of BL Lac objects in this survey are on average found to be poor clusters, comparable in galaxy density to Abell richness class <0. Using the formalism developed by Longair & Seldner and the specific techniques employed by Yee & Green, a mean value for the galaxy--BL Lac two-point correlation function amplitude was found to be <Bgb> = 209 Mpc1.77 +/- 386 (mean +/-1 sigma spread for H0 = 50 km s-1 Mpc-1 and q0 = 0.02). Only a few (at most six of 45) BL Lacs in this sample are found in clusters with richness class >1, and most of these are at z > 0.4. Various subsamples of BL Lacs with unique qualities (e.g., presence/absence of weak emission lines, high/low optical core dominance or polarization, X-ray vs. radio-selected, etc.) have statistically similar clustering properties, which further argues that these BL Lacs are all members of the same active galactic nucleus (AGN) class. However, we do find that, like radio-loud quasars, BL Lac environments are significantly richer at high redshift (for z > 0.35, the median Bgb = 500 Mpc1.77 compared to a median Bgb = 120 Mpc1.77 at lower z). Correlations are also found between Bgb and host galaxy luminosity and radio core dominance. Contrary to the expectations of unification schemes for BL Lacs, the clustering environments of BL Lacs, at both high and low redshift, are more similar to those of FR 2 radio galaxies and quasars than to those of FR 1's. Approximately 20% of low-z FR 1's are in richer clusters than almost all low-z BL Lacs (PKS 0548-322 is the lone exception of a BL Lac in a rich cluster); similarly, 20% of FR 1's have more luminous host galaxies than any BL Lac (Paper I). This new line of evidence strongly suggests that the unification scenario for BL Lacs with FR 1 radio galaxies requires a critical reexamination. As a minimum the "parent population" of BL Lacs must be modified to exclude the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in rich clusters at low redshift. The great similarity in the cosmic evolution of the cluster environment for radio-loud quasars, FR 2 radio galaxies, and BL Lac objects between z ~ 0.5 and 0 strongly suggests that a common physical mechanism operates to create a rapid luminosity evolution for AGNs in rich clusters. Since X-ray observations find rapid cosmic evolution in the intracluster medium and cluster potential well over similar timescales, the rapidly changing gas density and/or galaxy-galaxy interaction rate could be responsible for the fading of luminous AGNs in rich clusters (Stocke & Perrenod; Roos).},

	Abstract = {Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) catalogs, we examined the optical environments around double-lobed radio sources. Previous studies have shown that multi-component radio sources exhibiting some degree of bending between components are likely to be found in galaxy clusters. Often this radio emission is associated with a cD-type galaxy at the center of a cluster. We cross-correlated the SDSS and FIRST catalogs and measured the richness of the cluster environments surrounding both bent and straight multi-component radio sources. This led to the discovery and classification of a large number of galaxy clusters out to a redshift of z ~ 0.5. We divided our sample into smaller subgroups based on their optical and radio properties. We find that FR I radio sources are more likely to be found in galaxy clusters than FR II sources. Further, we find that bent radio sources are more often found in galaxy clusters than non-bent radio sources. We also examined the environments around single-component radio sources and find that single-component radio sources are less likely to be associated with galaxy clusters than extended, multi-component radio sources. Bent, visually selected sources are found in clusters or rich groups ~78% of the time. Those without optical hosts in SDSS are likely associated with clusters at even higher redshifts, most with redshifts of z>0.7.},

	Abstract = {The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscrued by optically thick circumstellar matter, particularly at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. In radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit radio through gamma-ray light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anistropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which includes radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and general properties of AGN. We summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission caused by circumstellar obscuration and relativistic beaming. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking the high-luminosity sources (BL Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies). Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN and conclude they probably are powered by similar physical processes, at least within the relativistic jet. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this field. (SECTION: Invited Review Paper)},

	Abstract = {Lower limits on the power emitted in ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), which are assumed to be protons with energy >~ 1017-1020 eV, are derived for TeV blazars with the assumption that the observed TeV gamma-rays are generated due to interactions of these protons with cosmic microwave photons. The limits depend on the spectrum of the injected UHECR protons. While for a --2.2 injection spectrum the lower limits on the powers emitted in UHECRs by 1ES 0229+200, 1ES 1101--232, and 1ES 0347--121 are lower than their respective synchrotron luminosities (~1046 erg s--1), in the case of 1ES 1426+428 it exceeds the corresponding synchrotron luminosity by up to an order of magnitude. The proposed Auger North Observatory should be able to detect 4 × 1019 eV cosmic-ray (CR) protons from 1ES 1426+428 within a few years of operation and test the TeV gamma-ray production model by UHECR energy losses while propagating along the line of sight or constrain the intergalactic magnetic field to be larger than ~10--16 G in case of no detection. The lower limits on the apparent-isotropic jet power from accelerated 1010-1020 eV proton spectra in the blazar jet is of the order of the Eddington luminosity of a 109 M &sun; black hole for a CR injection spectrum --2.2 or harder for all blazars considered except for 1ES 1426+428. In the case of the latter, the apparent-isotropic jet power exceeds the Eddington luminosity by an order of magnitude. For an injection spectrum softer than --2.2, as is required to fit the observed CR data above ~1017-1018 eV, the Eddington luminosity is exceeded by the lower limits on the jet power for all blazars considered.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a comparison between the environments of (1) a complete sample of 46 southern 2-Jy radio galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.05 < z < 0.7), (2) a complete sample of 20 radio-quiet type-2 quasars (0.3 <= z <= 0.41), and (3) a control sample of 107 quiescent early-type galaxies at 0.2 <= z < 0.7 in the Extended Groth Strip. The environments have been quantified using angular clustering amplitudes (Bgq) derived from deep optical imaging data. Based on these comparisons, we discuss the role of the environment in the triggering of powerful radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars. When we compare the Bgq distributions of the type-2 quasars and quiescent early-type galaxies, we find no significant difference between them. This is consistent with the radio-quiet quasar phase being a short-lived but ubiquitous stage in the formation of all massive early-type galaxies. On the other hand, powerful radio galaxies are in denser environments than the quiescent population, and this difference between distributions of Bgq is significant at the 3sigma level. This result supports a physical origin of radio loudness, with high-density gas environments favouring the transformation of active galactic nucleus (AGN) power into radio luminosity, or alternatively, affecting the properties of the supermassive black holes themselves. Finally, focusing on the radio-loud sources only, we find that the clustering of weak-line radio galaxies (WLRGs) is higher than the strong-line radio galaxies (SLRGs), constituting a 3sigma result. 82 per cent of the 2-Jy WLRGs are in clusters, according to our definition (Bgq ≳ 400), versus only 31 per cent of the SLRGs.},

	Abstract = {The paper `The cluster environments of powerful radio galaxies', by Richard M. Prestage and John A. Peacock was published in Mon. Not. R. astr. Soc., (1988) 230, 131-160. There was an error in the function H(z) used in this paper, which was too large by a factor (180/pi)^2-gamma^. Consequently, all quoted values of B_gg*_ (Tables 5-7) are too small and should be increased by this same factor which amounts to 2.537 for the adopted value of gamma=1.77. The value for B_gg_ is similarly affected; however, there was an additional error in the computer program which converted between A_gg_ and B_gg_. This increased the B_gg_. value by a factor of almost exactly 2, approximately cancelling the effect of the above error in H(z). After these corrections, the value of B_gg_ deduced from the Lick counts becomes 51. Thus, the values of B_gg*_/B_gg_ (Table 4) are too small and should be doubled. The discussion of the richness of radio galaxy environments remains unaltered. B_gg*_ values for Abell clusters were evaluated using the same method as for the radio galaxies, so the above global scaling factors do not affect the richness values inferred for the radio galaxies.},

Lick galaxy counts for z of less than 0.1 are extended to z of less than 0.25 using deep galaxy samples from UK Schmidt plates. Although the low-luminosity Fanaroff-Riley class I sources lie in richer clusters than those of class II, a real scatter in properties is found.

	Abstract = {We present a sample of 723 optically selected BL Lac candidates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) spectroscopic database encompassing 8250 deg2 of sky; our sample constitutes one of the largest uniform BL Lac samples yet derived. Each BL Lac candidate has a high-quality SDSS spectrum from which we determine spectroscopic redshifts for ~60% of the objects. Redshift lower limits are estimated for the remaining objects utilizing the lack of host galaxy flux contamination in their optical spectra; we find that objects lacking spectroscopic redshifts are likely at systematically higher redshifts. Approximately 80% of our BL Lac candidates match to a radio source in FIRST/NVSS, and ~40% match to a ROSAT X-ray source. The homogeneous multiwavelength coverage allows subdivision of the sample into 637 radio-loud BL Lac candidates and 86 weak-featured radio-quiet objects. The radio-loud objects broadly support the standard paradigm unifying BL Lac objects with beamed radio galaxies. We propose that the majority of the radio-quiet objects may be lower-redshift (z < 2.2) analogs to high-redshift weak line quasars (i.e., active galactic nucleus with unusually anemic broad emission line regions). These would constitute the largest sample of such objects, being of similar size and complementary in redshift to the samples of high-redshift weak line quasars previously discovered by the SDSS. However, some fraction of the weak-featured radio-quiet objects may instead populate a rare and extreme radio-weak tail of the much larger radio-loud BL Lac population. Serendipitous discoveries of unusual white dwarfs, high-redshift weak line quasars, and broad absorption line quasars with extreme continuum dropoffs blueward of rest-frame 2800 {\AA} are also briefly described.},

	Abstract = {We use statistical results from a large sample of about 500 blazars, based on two surveys, the Deep X-Ray Radio Blazar Survey (DXRBS), nearly complete, and the ROSAT All-Sky Survey-Green Bank Survey (RGB), to provide new constraints on the spectral energy distribution of blazars, particularly flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). This reassessment is prompted by the discovery of a population of FSRQs with spectral energy distribution similar to that of high-energy-peaked BL Lac objects. The fraction of these sources is sample dependent, being ~10% in DXRBS and ~30% in RGB (and reaching ~80% for the Einstein Medium Sensitivity Survey). We show that these ``X-ray-strong'' radio quasars, which had gone undetected or unnoticed in previous surveys, indeed are the strong-lined counterparts of high-energy-peaked BL Lac objects and have synchrotron peak frequencies, nupeak, much higher than ``classical'' FSRQs, typically in the UV band for DXRBS. Some of these objects may be 100 GeV to TeV emitters, as are several known BL Lac objects with similar broadband spectra. Our large, deep, and homogeneous DXRBS sample does not show anticorrelations between nupeak and radio, broad-line region, or jet power, as expected in the so-called blazar sequence scenario. However, the fact that FSRQs do not reach X-ray-to-radio flux ratios and nupeak values as extreme as BL Lac objects and the elusiveness of high-nupeak high-power blazars suggest that there might be an intrinsic, physical limit to the synchrotron peak frequency that can be reached by strong-lined, powerful blazars. Our findings have important implications for the study of jet formation and physics and its relationship to other properties of active galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {Our knowledge of the blazar surface densities and luminosity functions, which are fundamental parameters, relies still on samples at relatively high flux limits. As a result, our understanding of this rare class of active galactic nuclei is mostly based on relatively bright and intrinsically luminous sources. We present the radio number counts, evolutionary properties, and luminosity functions of the faintest blazar sample with basically complete (~95%) identifications. Based on the Deep X-Ray Radio Blazar Survey (DXRBS), it includes 129 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and 24 BL Lac objects down to a 5 GHz flux and power ~50 mJy and ~1024 W Hz-1, respectively, an order of magnitude improvement as compared to previously published (radio-selected) blazar samples. DXRBS FSRQs are seen to evolve strongly, up to redshift ~1.5, above which high-power sources show a decline in their comoving space density. DXRBS BL Lac objects, on the other hand, do not evolve. High-energy and low-energy peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs and LBLs, respectively) share the same lack of cosmological evolution, which is at variance with some previous results. The observed luminosity functions are in good agreement with the predictions of unified schemes, with FSRQs getting close to their expected minimum power. Despite the fact that the large majority of our blazars are FSRQs, BL Lac objects are intrinsically ~50 times more numerous. Finally, the relative numbers of HBLs and LBLs in the radio and X-ray bands are different from those predicted by the so-called blazar sequence and support a scenario in which HBLs represent a small minority (~10%) of all BL Lac objects.},

	Abstract = {We study the effects of radio jets on galaxies in their vicinity (satellites) and the role of satellites in triggering radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The study compares the aggregate properties of satellites of a sample of 7,220 radio AGNs at z < 0.3 (identified by Best & Heckman 2012 from the SDSS and NVSS+FIRST surveys) to the satellites of a control sample of radio-quiet galaxies, which are matched in redshift, color, luminosity, and axis ratio, as well as by environment type: field galaxies, cluster members and brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Remarkably, we find that radio AGNs exhibit on average a 50% excess (17{\sigma} significance) in the number of satellites within 100 kpc even though the cluster membership was controlled for (e.g., radio BCGs have more satellites than radio-quiet BCGs, etc.). Satellite excess is not confirmed for high-excitation sources, which are only 2% of radio AGN. Extra satellites may be responsible for raising the probability for hot gas AGN accretion via tidal effects or may otherwise enhance the intensity or duration of the radio-emitting phase. Furthermore, we find that the incidence of radio AGNs among potential hosts (massive ellipticals) is similar for field galaxies and for non-BCG cluster members, suggesting that AGN fueling depends primarily on conditions in the host halo rather than the parent, cluster halo. Regarding feedback, we find that radio AGNs, either high or low excitation, have no detectable effect on star formation in their satellites, as neither induced star formation nor star formation quenching is present in more than ~1% of radio AGN.},

	Abstract = {We present K-band imaging for 15 of the CNOC1 clusters. The extensive spectroscopic data set available for these clusters allows us to determine the cluster K-band luminosity function and density profile without the need for statistical background subtraction. The luminosity density and number density profiles can be described by NFW models with concentration parameters of cl=4.28+/-0.70 and cg=4.13+/-0.57, respectively. Comparing these to the dynamical mass analysis of the same clusters shows that they are similar to the cluster dark matter profile. The luminosity functions show that the evolution of K* over the redshift range 0.2<z<0.5 is consistent with a scenario in which the majority of stars in cluster galaxies form at high redshift (zf>1.5) and evolve passively thereafter. The best fit for the faint-end slope of the luminosity function is alpha=-0.84+/-0.08, which indicates that it does not evolve between z=0 and 0.3. Using principal component analysis of the spectra, we classify cluster galaxies as either star-forming/recently star-forming (EM+BAL) or non-star-forming (ELL) and compute their respective luminosity functions. The faint-end slope of the ELL luminosity function is much shallower than for the EM+BAL galaxies at z=0.3 and suggests that the number of faint ELL galaxies in clusters decreases by a factor of ~3 from z=0 to 0.3. The redshift evolution of K* for both EM+BAL and ELL types is consistent with a passively evolving stellar population formed at high redshift. Passive evolution in both classes demonstrates that the bulk of the stellar population in all bright cluster galaxies is formed at high redshift, and subsequent transformations in morphology/color/spectral type have little effect on the total stellar mass.},

	Abstract = {Using K-band imaging for 15 of the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology (CNOC1) clusters we examine the near-infrared properties of moderate-redshift (0.19<z<0.55) galaxy clusters. We find that the number of K-band selected cluster galaxies within R500 (the halo occupation number, HON) is well correlated with the cluster dynamical mass (M 500) and X-ray temperature (TX); however, the intrinsic scatter in these scaling relations is 37% and 46%, respectively. Comparison with clusters in the local universe shows that the HON-M500 relation does not evolve significantly between z=0 and z~0.3. This suggests that if dark matter halos are disrupted or undergo significant tidal stripping in high-density regions as seen in numerical simulations, the stellar mass within the halos is tightly bound, and not removed during the process. The total K-band cluster light (L200,K) and K-band-selected richness (parameterized by Bgc,K) are also correlated with both the cluster TX and M200. The total (intrinsic) scatter in the L200,K-M200 and Bgc,K-M200 relations are 43% (31%) and 35% (18%), respectively, and indicates that for massive clusters both L200,K and Bgc,K can predict M200 with accuracy similar to that of TX, LX, or optical richness (Bgc). Examination of the mass-to-light ratios of the clusters shows that similarly to local clusters, the K-band mass-to-light ratio is an increasing function of halo mass. Using the K-band mass-to-light ratios of the clusters, we apply the Oort technique and find Omegam,0=0.22+/-0.02, which agrees well with recent combined concordance cosmology parameters, but, similarly to previous cluster studies, is on the low-density end of preferred values.},

	Abstract = {We present number counts, luminosity functions (LFs) and luminosity densities of galaxies obtained using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Sixth Data Release (SDSS DR6) in all SDSS photometric bands. Thanks to the SDSS DR6, galaxy statistics have increased by a factor of ~7 in the u band and by a factor between ~3 and ~5 in the rest of the SDSS bands with respect to the previous work of Blanton et al. In addition, we have ensured a high redshift completeness in our galaxy samples, mainly by minimizing the effect of brightness-dependent incompleteness. With these advances, we have estimated very accurate SDSS DR6 LFs at both the bright and the faint end. In the 0.1r band, our LF is well fitted by a Schechter LF with parameters Phi* = 0.93 +/- 0.07,M* - 5log10h = -20.71 +/- 0.04 and alpha = -1.26 +/- 0.02. As compared with previous results, we find some notable differences. At the bright end of the 0.1u-band LF we find a remarkable excess, of ~1.7dex at , with respect to the best-fitting Schechter LF. This excess weakens in the 0.1g band, fading away towards the very red 0.1z band. A preliminary analysis on the nature of this bright-end bump reveals that it is composed of quasi-stellar objects/type 1 Seyferts (~60per cent), starbursts and star-forming galaxies (~20 per cent) and normal galaxies (~20 per cent). It seems, therefore, that an important fraction of this excess luminosity may come from nuclear activity. At the faint end of the SDSS DR6 LFs, where we can reach 0.5-1mag deeper than the previous SDSS LF estimations, we obtain a steeper slope that increases from the 0.1u band, with alpha = -1.05 +/- 0.05, to the very red 0.1z band, with alpha = -1.26 +/- 0.03. We have also investigated the effect of galaxy evolution on our LFs. These state-of-the-art results may be used to constrain a variety of aspects of star formation histories and/or feedback processes in galaxy formation models.},

	Abstract = {We revisit the concept of a blazar sequence that relates the synchrotron peak frequency (nupeak) in blazars with synchrotron peak luminosity (L peak, in nuL nu) using a large sample of radio-loud active galactic nuclei. We present observational evidence that the blazar sequence is formed from two populations in the synchrotron nupeak-L peak plane, each forming an upper edge to an envelope of progressively misaligned blazars, and connecting to an adjacent group of radio galaxies having jets viewed at much larger angles to the line of sight. When binned by jet kinetic power (L kin; as measured through a scaling relationship with extended radio power), we find that radio core dominance decreases with decreasing synchrotron L peak, revealing that sources in the envelope are generally more misaligned. We find population-based evidence of velocity gradients in jets at low kinetic powers (~1042-1044.5 erg s-1), corresponding to Fanaroff-Riley (FR) I radio galaxies and most BL Lac objects. These low jet power "weak-jet" sources, thought to exhibit radiatively inefficient accretion, are distinguished from the population of non-decelerating, low synchrotron-peaking (LSP) blazars and FR II radio galaxies ("strong" jets) which are thought to exhibit radiatively efficient accretion. The two-population interpretation explains the apparent contradiction of the existence of highly core-dominated, low-power blazars at both low and high synchrotron peak frequencies, and further implies that most intermediate synchrotron peak sources are not intermediate in intrinsic jet power between LSP and high synchrotron-peaking (HSP) sources, but are more misaligned versions of HSP sources with similar jet powers.},

	Abstract = {In examining a select sample of over 200 blazars of known jet kinetic power (L_kin) and well-characterized SEDs, we found (Meyer et al., 2011) that Intermediate synchrotron-peaking (ISP) blazars may have lower gamma-ray output than high synchrotron-peaking (HSP) blazars of similar L_kin, consistent with our hypothesis that ISP blazars are less-beamed versions of HSP blazars, rather than a distinct population. Further, by using the radio core dominance as a measure of relative beaming, we find that gamma-ray luminosity depends on beaming in a consistent way for blazars ranging over all jet kinetic powers (10^42 - 10^46 ergs/s). We re-examine the gamma-ray properties of this core sample of blazars using the 1-year LAT catalog (Abdo et al., 2010). We find that for weak jets, the ratio of inverse Compton to synchrotron emission remains constant with increased beaming, consistent with an SSC model for the jet emission, while the most powerful jets show a strong increase in Compton dominance with orientation, consistent with an external Compton (EC) emission model.},

	Abstract = {We present the first collective evidence that Fermi-detected jets of high kinetic power (L kin) are dominated by inverse Compton emission from upscattered external photons. Using a sample with a broad range in orientation angle, including radio galaxies and blazars, we find that very high power sources (L kin > 1045.5 erg s-1) show a significant increase in the ratio of inverse Compton to synchrotron power (Compton dominance) with decreasing orientation angle, as measured by the radio core dominance and confirmed by the distribution of superluminal speeds. This increase is consistent with beaming expectations for external Compton (EC) emission, but not for synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission. For the lowest power jets (L kin < 1043.5 erg s-1), no trend between Compton and radio core dominance is found, consistent with SSC. Importantly, the EC trend is not seen for moderately high power flat spectrum radio quasars with strong external photon fields. Coupled with the evidence that jet power is linked to the jet speed, this finding suggests that external photon fields become the dominant source of seed photons in the jet comoving frame only for the faster and therefore more powerful jets.},

	Abstract = {The X-ray emission mechanism in large-scale jets of powerful radio quasars has been a source of debate in recent years, with two competing interpretations: either the X-rays are of synchrotron origin, arising from a different electron energy distribution than that producing the radio to optical synchrotron component, or they are due to inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons (IC/CMB) by relativistic electrons in a powerful relativistic jet with bulk Lorentz factor Gamma ~ 10-20. These two models imply radically different conditions in the large-scale jet in terms of jet speed, kinetic power, and maximum energy of the particle acceleration mechanism, with important implications for the impact of the jet on the large-scale environment. A large part of the X-ray origin debate has centered on the well-studied source 3C 273. Here we present new observations from Fermi which put an upper limit on the gamma-ray flux from the large-scale jet of 3C 273 that violates at a confidence greater that 99.9% the flux expected from the IC/CMB X-ray model found by extrapolation of the UV to X-ray spectrum of knot A, thus ruling out the IC/CMB interpretation entirely for this source when combined with previous work. Further, this upper limit from Fermi puts a limit on the Doppler beaming factor of at least delta < 9, assuming equipartition fields, and possibly as low as delta < 5, assuming no major deceleration of the jet from knots A through D1.},

	Abstract = {We selected a sample of 437 BL Lac objects, taken from the RomaBZCat catalogue, for which spectroscopic information and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry are available. We propose a new classification of BL Lacs in which the sources' type is not defined only on the basis of the peak frequency of the synchrotron component in their spectral energy distribution (types L and H), but also on the relevance of this component with respect to the brightness of the host galaxy (types N and G, for nucleus- or galaxy-dominated sources). We found that the SDSS colour index u-r = 1.4 is a good separator between these two types. We used multiband colour-colour plots to study the properties of the BL Lac classes and found that in the X-ray to radio flux ratio versus u-r plot most of the N (blue) sources are located in a rather narrow strip, while the G (red) sources are spread in a large area, and most of them are located in galaxy clusters or interacting systems, suggesting that their X-ray emission is not from a genuine BL Lac nucleus but it is related to their environment. Of the about 135 sources detected in the gamma rays by Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, nearly all belong to the N-type, indicating that only this type of sources should be considered as genuine BL Lac nuclei. The J-H, H-K plot of sources detected in the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) catalogue is consistent with that of the 'bona fide' BL Lac objects, independently of their N or G classification from the optical indices, indicating the existence in G-type sources of a K-band excess possibly due to a steep, low frequency peaked emission which deserves further investigations. We propose to use these colour plots as a further tool for searching candidate counterparts of newly discovered high-energy sources.},

	Abstract = {Blazars constitute the most interesting and enigmatic class of extragalactic gamma-ray sources dominated by non-thermal emission. In this Letter, we show how the Wide Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) infrared data make it possible to identify a distinct region of the [3.4]-[4.6]-[12] mum color-color diagram where the sources dominated by the thermal radiation are separated from those dominated by non-thermal emission, in particular the blazar population. This infrared non-thermal region, which we indicate as the WISE blazar strip (WBS), will constitute a new powerful diagnostic tool when the full WISE survey data are released. The WBS can be used to extract new blazar candidates, to identify those of uncertain type and also to search for the counterparts of unidentified gamma-ray sources. We show one example of the value of the use of the WBS identifying the TeV source VER J0648+152, recently discovered by VERITAS.},

	Abstract = {Blazars are the most extreme class of active galactic nuclei. Despite a previous investigation at 102 MHz for a small sample of BL Lac objects and our recent analysis of blazars detected in the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey, a systematic study of the blazar spectral properties at frequencies below 100 MHz has been never carried out. In this paper, we present the first analysis of the radio spectral behavior of blazars based on the recent Very Large Array Low-frequency Sky Survey (VLSS) at 74 MHz. We search for blazar counterparts in the VLSS catalog, confirming that they are detected at 74 MHz. We then show that blazars present radio-flat spectra (i.e., radio spectral indices of ~0.5) when evaluated, which also about an order of magnitude in frequency lower than previous analyses. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of the blazars-radio galaxies connection since the low-frequency radio data provide a new diagnostic tool to verify the expectations of the unification scenario for radio-loud active galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Several problems regarding the process of galaxy formation are still open. One of them is the role played by AGN phenomena in contributing to galaxy build-up and to Star Formation (SF) quenching. On the other hand, the theory of AGN formation predicts these phenomena to be correlated with the host-galaxy environment, thus opening for links between SF quenching, environment and AGN phenomena in the galaxy formation paradigm. This work is focused on the study of the correlation between environmental density and radio AGN presence. Using data from the photometric COSMOS survey and the radio 1.4GHz VLA-COSMOS, a sample of radio AGNs has been defined. The environment has been studied throughout the use of the richness distributions inside a parallelepipedon with base side of 1 Mpc and height proportional to the photometric redshift precision. Richness distributions have been compared as a function of both the redshift and the relative evolution of the stellar masses of galaxies and AGN hosts up to $z=2$. Radio AGNs are always located in environments that are significantly denser than those around galaxies in which radio emission is absent. Therefore, the environment seems to enhance the probability of a galaxy to host a radio AGN. Moreover, a distinction between high power and low power radio AGNs leads to the conclusion that the significance in the environmental effect is maintained only for low power radio sources. By studying the evolution of stellar masses it is possible to conclude that radio AGN presence is a phenomenon related to quiescent galaxies up to $z=2$, with a significant increase of the fraction of quiescent galaxies hosting a radio AGN with decreasing redshift. Hints of an environmental effect are present. The results found with this work lead to conclude that denser environments play a significant role in enhancing the probability of a galaxy to host a low power radio AGN.},

	Abstract = {Clustering of galaxies about extragalactic radio sources is investigated by cross correlating the radio positions of 3CR and 4C sources with the positions of Zwicky galaxies and galaxies included in Lick counts. The cross-correlation functions are used to determine a linear clustering scale that ranges from galaxies selected at random in the universe to rich clusters of galaxies. It is found that: (1) the cross-correlation function for galaxies about radio sources has the same form as the galaxy-galaxy autocorrelation function on angular scales less than 1.5 deg of arc; (2) very weak radio galaxies show no tendency to belong to groups or clusters of galaxies; (3) on the average, extended powerful radio sources are observed in regions of space where the amplitude of the spatial cross-correlation function is about four to five times that of galaxies selected at random; (4) classical double sources with strong emission-line spectra have a cross-correlation function with galaxies similar to that of randomly selected galaxies; and (5) complex radio sources associated with galaxies having only an absorption-line spectrum or a weak emission spectrum belong to groups and clusters of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {In order to understand the formation and subsequent evolution of galaxies one must first distinguish between the two main morphological classes of massive systems: spirals and early-type systems. This paper introduces a project, Galaxy Zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly one million galaxies, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This achievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visually inspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. The project has obtained more than 4 × 107 individual classifications made by ~105 participants. We discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how the classifications were performed and processed. We find that Galaxy Zoo results are consistent with those for subsets of SDSS galaxies classified by professional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provide a robust morphological catalogue. Obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspection avoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such as colour, concentration or structural parameters. In addition, this catalogue can be used to directly compare SDSS morphologies with older data sets. The colour-magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and we illustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colour alone as a proxy for morphology.

	Abstract = {Aims: The BL Lac object RGB 1745+398 lies in an environment that makes it possible to study the cluster around it more deeply than the environments of other BL Lac objects. The cluster centered on the BL Lac works as a strong gravitational lens, forming a large arc around itself. The aim of this paper is to study the environment and characteristics of this object more accurately than the environments of other BL Lac objects have been before.  Methods: We measured the redshifts of galaxies in the cluster from the absorption lines in their spectra. The velocity dispersion was then obtained from the redshifts. The gravitational lensing was used for measuring the mass at the center of the cluster. The mass of the whole cluster could then be estimated using the softened isothermal sphere mass distribution. Finally, the richness of the cluster was determined by counting the number of galaxies near the BL Lac object and obtaining the galaxy-BL Lac spatial covariance function, B_gb.  Results: The redshifts of nine galaxies in the field were measured to be near the redshift of the BL Lac object, confirming the presence of a cluster. The average redshift of the cluster is 0.268, and the velocity dispersion (470^+190-110) km s-1. The mass of the cluster is M500 = (4^+3-2)×1014 Mo, which implies a rather massive cluster. The richness measurement also suggests that this is a rich cluster: the result for covariance function is B_gb = (600$\pm$200) Mpc1.77, which corresponds to Abell richness class 1 and which is consistent with the mass and velocity dispersion of the cluster.},

	Abstract = {Context. Properties of galaxies depend on their large-scale environment. As the influence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy evolution is becoming more evident, their large-scale environments may help us understand the evolutionary processes leading to activity. The effect of activity can be seen particularly by showing whether different types of active galaxies are formed by similar mechanisms.  Aims: Our aim is to study the supercluster-scale environments of active galaxies up to redshift 0.4. Our data include quasars, BL Lac objects, Seyfert, and radio galaxies.  Methods: We used a three-dimensional, low-resolution luminosity-density field constructed of a sample of luminous red galaxies in the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We calculated the average density of this field in a volume of a 3 h-1 Mpc sphere around each AGN for estimating the environmental density levels of different types of AGN. This analysis gives us the distribution of AGN in the global environment of superclusters, filaments, and voids.  Results: Our results show that, while radio-quiet quasars and Seyfert galaxies are mostly located in low-density regions, radio galaxies have higher environmental densities. BL Lac objects usually have low-density environments, but some of them are also in very high-density regions.  Conclusions: Our results give support to the theory of galaxy evolution where galaxies are affected by two modes of AGN feedback: quasar mode that turns a blue star-forming galaxy into a red and dead one, and radio mode that regulates the growth of massive elliptical galaxies. We conclude that quasars are in lower density environments than radio galaxies, most likely because the galaxies in rich environments have evolved to a state suitable for radio-loud activity earlier. Galaxies in poor environment have evolved more slowly, and are still going through the earlier quasar-mode feedback in galaxy evolution.},

	Abstract = {Context. The majority of all galaxies reside in groups of fewer than 50 member galaxies. These groups are distributed in various large-scale environments from voids to superclusters. Aims: The evolution of galaxies is affected by the environment in which they reside. Our aim is to study the effects of the local group scale and the supercluster scale environments on galaxy evolution. Methods: We use a luminosity-density field to determine the density of the large-scale environment of galaxies in groups of various richnesses. We calculate the fractions of different types of galaxies in groups with richnesses of up to 50 member galaxies and in different large-scale environments from voids to superclusters. Results: The fraction of passive elliptical galaxies rises and the fraction of star-forming spiral galaxies declines when the richness of a group of galaxies rises from two to approximately ten galaxies. On large scales, passive elliptical galaxies become more numerous than star-forming spirals when the environmental density grows to values typical of superclusters. The large-scale environment affects the level of these fractions in groups: galaxies in equally rich groups are more likely to be elliptical in supercluster environments than at lower densities. The crossing point, where the number of passive and star-forming galaxies is equal, occurs in superclusters in groups that are of lower richness than in voids. Galaxies in low-density environments need to occupy richer groups to evolve from star-forming to passive than galaxies in high-density environments. Groups in superclusters are on average more luminous than groups in large-scale environments of lower density. These results imply that the large-scale environment affects the properties of galaxies and groups. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the evolution of galaxies is affected by both, the group in which the galaxy resides and its large-scale environment. Galaxies in lower-density regions develop later than galaxies in similar mass groups in high-density environments.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray spectroscopy of 10 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) that are candidates to have an X-ray spectrum dominated by jet synchrotron emission. In all these FSRQ, which are less strongly relativistically beamed than blazars, a considerable contribution from a power-law component similar to that present in radio-quiet quasars is required to explain the observed X-ray fluxes and X-ray spectral slopes. As in radio-quiet quasars, their relatively high optical/UV fluxes can be accounted for by a significant contribution from thermal accretion disk emission. The lack of success in finding radio quasars with synchrotron X-rays is attributed to the adopted selection criteria, which were based on the multiwavelength flux ratios of BL Lacertae objects. A refined selection technique, which also involves radio imaging, is proposed to search for these important candidates with the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). On the other hand, the discovered FSRQ with their strong accretion disk signatures are expected to be important probes for studying the poorly understood accretion disk-jet connection.},

The K-corrections are reviewed with available UV data, and the necessary assumptions and model input parameters. In particular the possibility that the bulges of spiral galaxies have evolved in a form similar to that expected for elliptical galaxies is explored. The inclusion of bulge evolution predicts significantly more galaxies and may be consistent with the steepening count-magnitude slope at faint magnitudes. A significant fraction of Bj = 23 galaxies could be luminous compact objects with redshifts greater than 1 seen during their epoch of rapid star formation.},

	Abstract = {We construct a catalog of radio sources detected by the Green Bank 6 cm survey GB6, Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) (20 cm), and Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) (92 cm) radio surveys, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical survey. The 2.7 million entries in the publicly-available master catalog are comprised of the closest three FIRST to NVSS matches (within 30'') and vice versa, and unmatched sources from each survey. Entries are supplemented by data from the other radio and optical surveys, where available. All objects with even a small probability of physical association are included, such that catalog users can easily implement their own selection criteria for data analysis. We perform data analysis in the ~ 3000 deg2 region of sky where the surveys overlap, which contains 140,000 NVSS-FIRST sources, of which 64,000 are detected by WENSS and 12,000 by GB6. About one third of each sample is detected by the SDSS. An automated classification method based on 20 cm fluxes defines three radio morphology classes: complex, resolved, and compact. Radio color-magnitude-morphology diagrams for these classes show structure suggestive of strong underlying physical correlations. Complex and resolved sources tend to have a steep spectral slope (alpha ~ -0.8) that is nearly constant from 6 to 92 cm, while the compact class (unresolved on ~5'' scale by FIRST) contains a significant number of flat-spectrum (alpha ~ 0) sources. In the optically-detected sample, quasars dominate the flat-spectrum compact sources while steep-spectrum and resolved objects contain substantial numbers of both quasars and galaxies. Differential radio counts of quasars and galaxies are similar at bright flux levels (>100 mJy at 20 cm), while at fainter levels the quasar counts are significantly reduced below galaxy counts. The optically-undetected sample is strongly biased toward steep-spectrum sources. In samples of quasars and galaxies with SDSS spectra (2885 and 1288 respectively), we find that radio properties such as spectral slope, morphology, and radio loudness are correlated with optical color and luminosity.},

	Abstract = {We study the environments of low-redshift (z < 0.5) quasars based on a large and homogeneous data set from the Stripe 82 region of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We have compared the <1 Mpc scale environments of 302 quasars that were resolved in our recent study to those of 288 inactive galaxies with closely matched redshifts. Crucially, the luminosities of the inactive galaxies and the quasar host galaxies are also closely matched, unlike in most previous studies. The environmental overdensities were studied by measuring the number density of galaxies within a projected distance of 200 kpc to 1 Mpc. The galaxy number density of the quasar environments is comparable to that of the inactive galaxies with similar luminosities, both classes of objects showing significant excess compared to the background galaxy density for distances <400 kpc. There is no significant dependence of the galaxy number density on redshift, quasar or host galaxy luminosity, black hole mass or radio loudness. This suggests that the fuelling and triggering of the nuclear activity is only weakly dependent on the local environment of quasars, and the quasar phase may be a short-lived common phase in the life cycle of all massive galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We propose a scenario where blazars are classified into flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects, low-synchrotron, or high-synchrotron peaked objects according to a varying mix of the Doppler-boosted radiation from the jet, the emission from the accretion disc, the broad-line region, and the light from the host galaxy. In this framework, the peak energy of the synchrotron power (?) in blazars is independent of source type and radio luminosity. We test this new approach, which builds upon unified schemes, using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, and show that it can provide simple answers to a number of long-standing issues, including, amongst others, the different cosmological evolution of BL Lac objects selected in the radio and X-ray bands, the larger ? values observed in BL Lac objects, the fact that high-synchrotron peaked blazars are always of BL Lac type, and the existence of FSRQ-BL Lac transition objects. Objects so far classified as BL Lac objects on the basis of their observed weak, or undetectable, emission lines are of two physically different classes: intrinsically weak lined objects, more common in X-ray-selected samples, and heavily diluted broad-lined sources, more frequent in radio-selected samples, which explains some of the confusion in the literature. We also show that strong selection effects are the main cause of the diversity observed in radio and X-ray samples, and that the correlation between luminosity and ?, which led to the proposal of the 'blazar sequence', is also a selection effect arising from the comparison between shallow radio and X-ray surveys, and to the fact that high-?-high-radio-power objects have never been considered because their redshift is not measurable.},

	Abstract = {We have recently proposed a new simplified scenario where blazars are classified as flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) or BL Lacs according to the prescriptions of unified schemes, and to a varying combination of Doppler-boosted radiation from the jet, emission from the accretion disc, the broad line region and light from the host galaxy. Here we extend our approach, previously applied to radio and X-ray surveys, to the gamma-ray band and, through detailed Monte Carlo simulations, compare our predictions to Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) survey data. Our simulations are in remarkable agreement with the overall observational results, including the percentages of BL Lacs and FSRQs, the fraction of redshift-less objects and the redshift, synchrotron peak and gamma-ray spectral index distributions. The strength and large scatter of the oft-debated observed gamma-ray-radio flux density correlation are also reproduced. In addition, we predict that almost 3/4 of Fermi-LAT BL Lacs, and basically all of those without redshift determination, are actually FSRQs with their emission lines swamped by the non-thermal continuum and as such should be considered. Finally, several of the currently unassociated high Galactic latitude Fermi sources are expected to be radio-faint blazars displaying a pure elliptical galaxy optical spectrum.},

	Abstract = {The CoNFIG (Combined NVSS-FIRST Galaxies) sample is a new sample of 274 bright radio sources at 1.4 GHz. It was defined by selecting all sources with S1.4GHz >= 1.3 Jy from the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS) in the north field of the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimetres (FIRST) survey. New radio observations obtained with the VLA for 31 of the sources are presented. The sample has complete Fanaroff-Riley (FRI)/FRII morphology identification; optical identifications and redshifts are available for 80 and 89 per cent of the sample, respectively, yielding a mean redshift of ~0.71. One of the goals of this survey is to get better definitions of luminosity distributions and source counts of FRI/FRII sources separately, in order to determine the evolution of the luminosity function for each type of source. We present a preliminary analysis, showing that these data are an important step towards examining various evolutionary schemes for these objects and to confirm or correct the dual population unified scheme for radio active galactic nuclei (AGN). Improving our understanding of radio galaxy evolution will give better insight into the role of AGN feedback in galaxy formation.},

	Abstract = {This paper focuses on a comparison of the space densities of Fanaroff-Riley type I (FRI) and FRII sources at different epochs, with a particular focus on FRI sources.  First, we present the concluding steps in constructing the Combined NVSS-FIRST Galaxies (CoNFIG) catalogue, including new Very Large Array observations, optical identifications and redshift estimates. The final catalogue consists of 859 sources over four samples (CoNFIG-1, -2, -3 and -4 with flux density limits of S1.4GHz = 1.3, 0.8, 0.2 and 0.05Jy, respectively). It is 95.7 per cent complete in radio morphology classification and 74.3 per cent of the sources have redshift data.  Combining CoNFIG with complementary samples, the distribution and evolution of FRI and FRII sources are investigated. We find that FRI sources undergo mild evolution and that, at the same radio luminosity, FRI and FRII sources show similar space density enhancements in various redshift ranges, possibly implying a common evolution.},

	Abstract = {The goal of this work is to determine the nature of the relation between morphology and accretion mode in radio galaxies, including environmental parameters. The CoNFIG extended catalogue (improved by new KS-band identifications and estimated redshifts from UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), and spectral index measurements from new GMRT observations) is used to select a sub-sample of 206 radio galaxies with z <= 0.3 over a wide range of radio luminosity, which are morphology-classified using the Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classification of extended radio sources. For each galaxy, spectroscopic data are retrieved to determine the high/low excitation status of the source, related to its accretion mode. Environmental factors, such as the host galaxy luminosity and a richness factor, are also computed, generally using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. We find the following results: (1) at a given radio luminosity, the FR morphological split of sources is consistent with being the same for both accretion modes. This remains true if analysis is restricted to only rich or only poor environments. If confirmed with a larger sample, this would imply that extended radio morphology is independent of the accretion mode of the black hole, depending only on the power of the resultant jet, and its interactions with the larger-scale environment. (2) Excitation modes seem to be linked to the source environment, with high-excitation galaxies found almost exclusively in low-density environments while low-excitation galaxies occupy a wider range of densities; this result is independent of FR morphology, and is consistent with the different fuelling mechanisms expected for these excitation modes. (3) Independent of excitation mode, FRI sources are found to lie in higher density environments, on average, than FRII sources, consistent with FRI sources having their jets disrupted by a denser surrounding medium. However, there is a significant overlap in environment between the two classes, and no clear driving factor between the FRI and FRII sources is found even when combining radio luminosity, accretion mode, large-scale environment and host galaxy luminosity.},

Using a counts-in-cell analysis, we identify a field as overdense when 15 or more red IRAC sources are found within 1' (i.e., 0.5 Mpc at 1.2 < z < 3) of the radio galaxy to the 5sigma flux density limits of our IRAC data (f 4.5 = 13.4 muJy). We find that radio galaxies lie preferentially in medium to dense regions, with 73% of the targeted fields denser than average. Our (shallow) 120 s data permit the rediscovery of previously known clusters and protoclusters associated with radio galaxies as well as the discovery of new promising galaxy cluster candidates at z > 1.2.},

	Abstract = {We estimate the galaxy density along lines of sight to hard extragalactic gamma-ray sources by correlating source positions on the sky with a void catalog based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Extragalactic gamma-ray sources that are detected at very high energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) or have been highlighted as VHE-emitting candidates in the Fermi Large Area Telescope hard source catalog (together referred to as "VHE-like" sources) are distributed along underdense lines of sight at the 2.4 sigma level. There is also a less suggestive correlation for the Fermi hard source population (1.7 sigma). A correlation between 10-500 GeV flux and underdense fraction along the line of sight for VHE-like and Fermi hard sources is found at 2.4 sigma and 2.6 sigma, respectively. The preference for underdense sight lines is not displayed by gamma-ray emitting galaxies within the second Fermi catalog, containing sources detected above 100 MeV, or the SDSS DR7 quasar catalog. We investigate whether this marginal correlation might be a result of lower extragalactic background light (EBL) photon density within the underdense regions and find that, even in the most extreme case of a entirely underdense sight line, the EBL photon density is only 2% less than the nominal EBL density. Translating this into gamma-ray attenuation along the line of sight for a highly attenuated source with opacity tau(E,z) ~5, we estimate that the attentuation of gamma-rays decreases no more than 10%. This decrease, although non-neglible, is unable to account for the apparent hard source correlation with underdense lines of sight.},

	Abstract = {Multislit spectroscopy and three-color CCD photometry of the galaxies in the cluster associated with the quasar 3C 206 (PKS 0837-12) at z = 0.198 are presented. This cluster is the richest environment of any low-redshift quasar observed in an Abell richness class 1 cluster. The cluster has a very flattened structure and a very concentrated core about the quasar. Most of the galaxies in this field have colors and luminosities consistent with normal galaxies at this redshift. The background-corrected blue fraction of galaxies is consistent with values for other rich clusters. The existence of several blue galaxies in the concentrated cluster core is an anomaly for a region of such high galaxy density, however, suggesting the absence of a substantial intracluster medium. This claim is supported by the Fanaroff-Riley (1974) class II morphology of the radio source. The velocity dispersion calculated from 11 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members is 500 + or - 110 km/s, which is slightly lower than the average for Abell class 1 clusters. A high frequency of interaction between the quasar host galaxy and cluster core members at low relative velocities, and a low intracluster gas pressure, may comprise a favorable environment for quasar activity. The properties of the cluster of galaxies associated with 3C 206 are consistent with this model.},

	Abstract = {It is shown here that the environments of radio-loud quasars have a strong effect on the optical evolution of the quasars. Quasars in rich clusters of galaxies are found to fade at least four optical magnitudes between redshifts 0.65 and 0.3, corresponding to a statistical e-folding fading time of about 1.0 Gyr. This rapid decrease in quasar activity is about four times as fast as quasars in poor environments. Several physical mechanisms of this evolution are suggested, emphasizing dynamical evolution of the cluster core and evolution in the amount of gaseous fuel in the cluster environment. The environments of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars are shown to be significantly different. Radio-quiet quasars are much less frequently situated in galaxy clusters as rich as Abell class I. This result is consistent with scenarios linking radio-loud quasars with elliptical host galaxies and radio-quiet quasars with spiral host galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Multiobject spectroscopy of galaxies associated with optically luminous quasars with z in the range of 0.15 to 0.6 is presented. The relative radial velocities of galaxies within 500 kpc of the quasars seem to be well described by a Gaussian distribution with a dispersion of 400-500 km/s. This result is independent of whether the quasar is radio-loud or radio-quiet, and, more surprisingly, whether it is located in a rich cluster of galaxies or in a poor group. Comparison with galaxy cluster dynamics for different environments indicates that the rich clusters of galaxies associated with quasars have anomalously low velocity dispersions, whereas the poor groups of galaxies may be dynamically normal. This result is consistent with models of quasar formation triggered by galaxy-galaxy interaction, where the efficiency of such interactions is much greater for low relative velocities.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents a study of the galaxy populations in 55 rich clusters along with a discussion of the implications for the formation and/or evolution of different morphological types. A well defined relationship is found between local galaxy density and galaxy type, which indicates an increasing elliptical and S0 population and a corresponding decrease in spirals with increasing density. Attention is given to evidence which contradicts the interpretation that these gradients in population result from the production of S0 galaxies when spirals are swept of disk gas by an IGM. In addition, as an alternative to the hypothesis of spiral sweeping, it is suggested that the local density/morphological-type relation reflects the long time scale associated with the formation of the disk component of galaxies. Finally, the data also indicate a trend of increasing luminosity of the spheroidal component with increasing local density.},

	Abstract = {We constructed a sample of 185 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) by cross-correlating Shen et al.'s Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3 (SDSS DR3) X-ray quasar sample with the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and Green Bank 6-cm survey (GB6) radio catalogues. From the spectral energy distribution (SED) constructed using multi-band (radio, UV, optical, infrared and X-ray) data, we derived the synchrotron peak frequency and peak luminosity. The black hole mass MBH and the broad-line region (BLR) luminosity (then the bolometric luminosity Lbol) were obtained by measuring the linewidth and strength of broad emission lines from SDSS spectra. We define a subsample of 118 FSRQs for which non-thermal jet emission is thought to dominate over thermal emission from the accretion disc and host galaxy. For this subsample, we found 25 FSRQs having synchrotron peak frequency nupeak > 1015Hz, which is higher than the typical value for FSRQs. These sources with high nupeak could be targets for the Fermi gamma-ray telescope. Only a weak anti-correlation is found between the synchrotron peak frequency and peak luminosity, while no strong correlation is present between either the synchrotron peak frequency and black hole mass or the synchrotron peak frequency and the Eddington ratio Lbol/LEdd. When combining the FSRQ subsample with Wu et al.'s sample of 170 BL Lac objects, a strong anti-correlation between the synchrotron peak frequency and luminosity is apparently present, covering about seven orders of magnitude in nupeak. However, the anti-correlation differs from the blazar sequence in having large scatter. At a similar peak frequency, the peak luminosity of FSRQs with nupeak > 1015Hz is systematically higher than that of BL Lac objects, with some FSRQs outside the range covered by BL Lac objects. Although high nupeak values are found in some FSRQs, they do not reach the extreme value of BL Lacs. For the subsample of 118 FSRQs, we found significant correlations between the peak luminosity and black hole mass, the Eddington ratio and the BLR luminosity, indicating that the jet physics may be strongly related to the accretion process.},

	Abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has been in operation since 2000 April. This paper presents the tenth public data release (DR10) from its current incarnation, SDSS-III. This data release includes the first spectroscopic data from the Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), along with spectroscopic data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) taken through 2012 July. The APOGEE instrument is a near-infrared R~22,500 300-fiber spectrograph covering 1.514--1.696 microns. The APOGEE survey is studying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 red giant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the Milky Way. DR10 includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or more times, from APOGEE. Derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities, effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are also included.DR10 also roughly doubles the number of BOSS spectra over those included in the ninth data release. DR10 includes a total of 1,507,954 BOSS spectra, comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra; 182,009 quasar spectra; and 159,327 stellar spectra, selected over 6373.2 square degrees.},
